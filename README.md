## City & Weather Information - 
This project is a simple web-based application, built as part of a school assignment, that fetches and displays data about a city in South Africa and its weather conditions over the last 24 hours. The data is retrieved using the Fetch API from two different sources, one for city details and the other for weather information.

## Note: 
The actual city and weather data is obtained from the respective APIs and output to the console. The frontend of the application provides an interface to input the city name and displays the fetched information.

## Technologies Used
Node.js
Express.js
node-fetch
HTML5
CSS
JavaScript

## Setup
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
Run the command npm install to install the project dependencies.
Running the Server
Start the server by running the command node index.js.
The server will be running on http://localhost:3000.

## Fetching City & Weather Data
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
Input a city name in the provided input field and click the 'Submit' button.
The server will fetch data from the respective APIs and display the information about the city and its weather on the webpage.

## Folder Structure
index.js: The server-side JavaScript file that handles the API requests and serves the static HTML file.
public/index.html: The HTML file that provides the frontend interface for inputting the city name and displaying the fetched data.
public/script.js: The client-side JavaScript file that sends the input city name to the server and updates the webpage with the fetched data.
public/style.css: The CSS file that provides the styling for the frontend interface.

## Note
While working on this project, I came across several challenges related to understanding and using APIs, error handling, and the Fetch API. However, I was able to overcome these challenges with the help of online resources and forums. 
The only challenge that i wasn't able to overcome was retrieving elevation data from the API, i tried several methods but was unsuccessful.
This project was a great learning experience for me as a student, and I gained a lot of valuable knowledge and experience.
